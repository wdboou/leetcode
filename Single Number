Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?


class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(int A[], int n) {
        // IMPORTANT: Please reset any member data you declared, as
        // the same Solution instance will be reused for each test case.
        while(--n!=0) A[n-1] ^=  A[n];
        return A[0];
    }
};
